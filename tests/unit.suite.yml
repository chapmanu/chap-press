# UNIT TEST CONFIGURATION
###############################
#
# Codeception uses PHPUnit as a backend for running its tests. 
# Thus, any PHPUnit test can be added to a Codeception test suite and then executed.
# 
# Create a test using the generate:test command with a suite and test names as parameters:
# 
#     codecept generate:test unit Example
# 
# It creates a new ExampleTest file located in the /tests/unit directory.
#
