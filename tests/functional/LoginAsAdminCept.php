/*
  Functional Tests -  Functional tests allows sending GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests to the WordPress installation index without requiring a web server. Functional tests donâ€™t require a web server. Acceptance tests do.

  In simple terms we set the $_REQUEST, $_GET and $_POST variables and then we execute the application from a test. This may be valuable, as functional tests are faster and provide detailed stack traces on failures.
